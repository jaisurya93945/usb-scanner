# 🛡️ USB Drive Scanner: Safeguard Your Data

Welcome to the **USB Drive Scanner** project! Whether you're a security professional, a cautious user, or just someone who values their data, this script is designed to help you keep your USB drives free from malware and other threats. With this tool, you can ensure that every connected USB drive is scanned and verified for safety before use.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **USB Drive Detection**: Automatically identifies all connected USB drives with comprehensive details.
- **Malware Scanning**: Checks files on your USB drives for known malicious patterns.
- **File Filtering**: Ignores default system files like `autorun.inf` and `desktop.ini` to focus on real threats.
- **Real-Time Reporting**: Provides immediate feedback on the safety of each USB drive scanned.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the USB Drive Scanner, follow these comprehensive steps:

1. **Clone the Repository, Install Dependencies, and Run the Script**

   Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine. Navigate into the project directory, install the required Python dependency `psutil`, and then run the script to start scanning your USB drives.

   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/jaisurya93945/usb-scanner.git
   cd usb-scanner

   # Install the required dependency
   pip install psutil

   # Run the script to start scanning USB drives
   python app.py
   ```

## 🔍 How It Works

The USB Drive Scanner performs the following steps to ensure your USB drives are safe:

1. **Detect USB Drives**: The script identifies all currently mounted USB drives on your system and retrieves key information about each one.
2. **Scan Files**: It systematically scans each file on the USB drives for suspicious content using predefined patterns like "malware", "virus", "trojan", and "ransomware".
3. **Report Results**: After scanning, the script provides a detailed report on the safety status of each USB drive, highlighting any detected threats.

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can customize the script to better suit your needs:

- **Suspicious Patterns**: Modify the `suspicious_patterns` list in the `is_malicious` function to include additional keywords or patterns relevant to your specific security concerns.
- **File Size Limit**: The script currently skips files larger than 10 MB to optimize performance. You can adjust this limit by changing the value in the `scan_files` function.

## 📝 Example Output

When you run the script, you might see output like this:

```
Scanning USB Drive: /dev/sdb1 (/media/usb)
Scanning file: /media/usb/important_document.txt | Size: 1.23 MB
Scanning file: /media/usb/malicious_file.exe | Size: 4.56 MB
Malicious content detected in: /media/usb/malicious_file.exe
Scanning progress: 2 files checked, 1 malicious files found
The USB drive /dev/sdb1 is NOT safe to use.
```
